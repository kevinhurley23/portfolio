      "As a musician, this project really appealed to me. I created this drum machine using React. I improved on freeCodeCamp's design in a few ways. Firstly, rather than using the sounds they provided, I created my own sounds using Native Instruments software. I also made it so that holding down a key does not retrigger the sounds, and I added text on either side of the toggle buttons to clarify their functions. Also, I think mine looks better!",

      "I think I improved on freeCodeCamp's design. My calculator has a backspace button in addition to the all clear button. The backspace button returns the last number to the display if an operator gets cleared. My calculator also doesn't allow the user to input an operator as the first character, expect for the negative sign. I created it using React.",

      "If you aren't familiar with a Pomodoro Clock (aka 25 + 5 clock), it facilitates alternating between periods of work and periods of rest by letting you set how long you want your work session to be and how long your break session will be. My app was created with jQuery. One way I improved on freeCodeCamp's design was to make the reset button return the clock to the values the user sets for session and break lengths, rather than returning to 25 minutes and 5 minutes respectively.",
